# Endometrial Cancer Deduction Using Image Data

This project focuses on the deduction and classification of Endometrial Cancer using image data, primarily leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to support early detection and diagnosis through automated image-based analysis.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Endometrial cancer is a common type of uterine cancer, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This repository includes the dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment pipeline for an end-to-end deep learning solution.
